Arrays in Python are commonly referred to as lists.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

In Python, a list is denoted by square brackets []

* It can hold elements of different data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists.
* Lists are mutable, which means you can modify them by adding, removing, or changing elements.
  
Consider the list 'fruits' and 'numbers' below

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]

    numbers = [20, 10, 0, -5]
# Task
