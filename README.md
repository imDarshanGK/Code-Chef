Arrays in Python are commonly referred to as lists.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

In Python, a list is denoted by square brackets []

* It can hold elements of different data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists.
* Lists are mutable, which means you can modify them by adding, removing, or changing elements.
  
Consider the list 'fruits' and 'numbers' below

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]

    numbers = [20, 10, 0, -5]
# Task

Write a program which does the following

* Create an Array of the first 5 positive integers - name it 'integers'
* Once the array is define - output "Done" to the console.
# While Loop
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
They are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

    while (condition):
        // code to be executed
Example

    counter = 0
    while counter < 5:
        print("The counter is:", counter)
        counter += 1
In the example above, the 'while' loop is executed as long as the condition 'counter < 5' is true.
The initial value of 'counter' is 0.

The code block inside the loop prints the value of 'counter' and increments it by 1 with the statement 'counter += 1'.
The loop will continue executing until 'counter' becomes equal to or greater than 5.

# Task
Write a program which does the following

 * Declare a variable a and initialise it to 0
 * Use the syntax above to create a loop, output the following to the console
      * Print a in separate lines as long as it is less than 7.
      * Increment a by 1 in each iteration.
